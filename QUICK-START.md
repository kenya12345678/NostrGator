# 🚀 NostrGator - Quick Start Guide

## What You Have
A complete, professional Nostr infrastructure with **19 services** including specialized relays, professional file hosting, and enterprise monitoring - all running locally with **proven open source technology**.

## Your Relay URLs (Ready to Use)
- **General**: `ws://localhost:7001` (Core notes and feeds)
- **DM**: `ws://localhost:7002` (Private messages)
- **Media**: `ws://localhost:7003` (File uploads and zaps)
- **Social**: `ws://localhost:7004` (Lists and communities)
- **Cache**: `ws://localhost:7005` (High-performance cache)

## Professional File Server
- **Web Dashboard**: `http://localhost:7006` (Full management interface)
- **NIP-96 & Blossom**: Automatic file uploads in supported clients
- **Public Gallery**: `http://localhost:7006/gallery` (Your uploaded files)

## Your Credentials
- **Public Key**: `npub1example1234567890abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz1234567890abcdef`
- **Private Key**: `nsec1example1234567890abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz1234567890abcdef`

⚠️ **SECURITY**: Replace with your actual keys! Only use your private key (nsec) in trusted Nostr clients. Never share it!

2. **Post a note**: Should appear instantly on your private relays
3. **Upload a file**: Test the professional file server at `http://localhost:7006`
4. **Explore the dashboard**: Check monitoring at `http://localhost:9090`

## 📁 Enhanced File Server Features

### **Professional File Hosting**
Your NostrGator includes a **professional-grade file server** with:
- **NIP-96 Protocol**: Standard Nostr file uploads
- **Blossom Protocol**: Modern, efficient file storage
- **Web Dashboard**: Full management interface at `http://localhost:7006`
- **Public Gallery**: Showcase your uploads at `http://localhost:7006/gallery`

- **Lightning Ready**: Payment integration for file hosting (optional)

### **Client Integration**
**Supported Clients:**
- **Amethyst** (Android): Auto-detects your file server
- **Nostrudel** (Web): Full NIP-96 support
- **Coracle** (Web): Basic file upload support
- **Damus** (iOS): Limited NIP-96 support

**How It Works:**
1. **Upload in client**: Select image/video in your Nostr client
2. **Auto-detection**: Client finds your file server via NIP-96 discovery
3. **Local storage**: Files stored on your machine, served instantly
4. **Note publishing**: Client publishes note with file URL to relays

### **File Server Benefits**
- **Lightning Fast**: Local storage = instant uploads/downloads
- **Complete Privacy**: Files never leave your machine
- **No Size Limits**: Upload as much as your disk space allows
- **Professional Interface**: Web dashboard for file management
- **Standards Compliant**: Full NIP-96 and Blossom protocol support
- **Future-Proof**: Ready for Lightning payments and advanced features
3. **Send a DM**: Test encrypted messaging through your DM relay
4. **Create a backup**: Run `.\scripts\backup.ps1 -Compress`

### Integration Strategy
- **Primary**: Use private relays for your main activity (fast, private)
- **Discovery**: Keep some public relays for finding new content
- **Backup**: Your events are stored both privately and publicly
- **Performance**: Private relays respond in 1-5ms vs 100-500ms for public

## 🔄 Maintenance Schedule

### Daily
- Relays run automatically (no action needed)

### Weekly  
- Create backup: `.\scripts\backup.ps1 -Compress`
- Check status: `.\scripts\verify.ps1`

### Monthly
- Update images: `docker compose pull && docker compose up -d`
- Review logs: `docker compose logs --tail=100`

## 🆘 Need Help?

### Quick Fixes
```powershell
# Restart everything
docker compose restart

# Check what's wrong
.\scripts\verify.ps1 -Detailed

# View recent logs
docker compose logs --tail=20
```

### Common Issues
- **Port conflicts**: Change ports in `docker-compose.yml`
- **Permission errors**: Run PowerShell as Administrator
- **Client won't connect**: Ensure URLs use `ws://` not `wss://`
